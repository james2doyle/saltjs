======

salt.js is micro DOM selector library. Minified, it comes in at 240 bytes! (with attribution...)

Here is a [quick video](http://youtu.be/kTA7TNpB9dg) showing it off

### No longer the smallest

It looks like there are a couple ways to do this in even less code...

#### Other versions

### How it works

It uses an array string to map different queries you pass through it to their native get functions.

```javascript
// get by id
$('#iddiv');
// get by class name
$('.classdiv');
// get by element name
$('@namediv');
// get by element tag name
$('=div');
// get element by query selector
$('*div div.inside');
// getAttribute of name
$('#iddiv').getAttribute('name');
// getAttribute of name from nodelist
$('.classdiv')[0].getAttribute('name');
```

### Fun with Mapping

Here are a couple of little things you can do to shorten some syntax.

```javascript
// probably the most useful and allows $('#iddiv').find('.inside')
Element.prototype.find = Element.prototype.querySelectorAll;
// another useful one for doing $('.inside').forEach()
NodeList.prototype.forEach = Array.prototype.forEach;
// $().attr('prop', 'value') support
Element.prototype.attr = function(name, value) {
  if(value) {
    this.setAttribute(name, value);
  } else {
    return this.getAttribute(name);
  }
};
// $().css('prop', 'value') support
Element.prototype.css = function(prop, value) {
  if (value) {
    this.style[prop] = value;
  } else {
    return this.style[prop];
  }
};
// $().on('event', function(el){});
Element.prototype.on = function(evt, fn) {
  this['on'+evt] = fn.bind(this);
};
```

So you can keep doing this with native commands and get something pretty close to jQuery.

If you used all of those you could turn this:

```javascript
var items = document.getElementById('iddiv').querySelectorAll('.inside');
for (var i = items.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
  items[i].setAttribute('name', 'Guy Dude Bro');
}
```

into this:

```javascript
$('#iddiv').find('.inside').forEach(function(elem){
  elem.attr('name', 'Guy Dude Bro');
});
```

### jsPerf testing

[jsPerf test](http://jsperf.com/micro-selector-libraries)

The reason I don't just use querSelectorAll for everything is because it is slower than the native get commands*.

[See this jsperf test](http://jsperf.com/getelementbyid-vs-queryselector/11)

Yes, I know that this library is slower than native gets, sometimes massively. But the point here is to beat querySelectorAll and it does it's job by that standard.

### I don't like FOO for selecting BAR

Cool. Change it up! You can choose your own mapping methods if you want. Just change the key in the 'matches' object and you are good.

### X returns an array!

That is because you are using a selector that has a live [nodelist](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/DOM/NodeList) collection.
